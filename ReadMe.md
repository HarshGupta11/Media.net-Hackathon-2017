Personal Suggester
	This website is used to suggest personal recommendation based on user interest that is derived from user's history
Installation
	For Ubuntu
	Clone the project github into your home directory
	run sudo make full in the console
Usage
	In the Personal-Suggester folder, run python manage.py runserver
	Then open localhost:8000 for view the website
Issues
	Because of server limitations, our website can take upto 5 minutes for giving personal suggestions.
	But it can be solved by moving the website to AWS.
	It will not work behind proxy settings.
Licence
	Anyone is free to copy, modify and distribute the code.
Additional Information
	We are planning to replace the website to chrome extension.
	We are using Django for our project.
